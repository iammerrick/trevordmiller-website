              The project has a <Anchor href='https://github.com/trevordmiller/trevordmiller-website/blob/master/package.json'>minimal package.json</Anchor>. This file declares dependencies, scripts, and some config for compilation and linting. The only steps needed to work in the app are to clone it, run <Code>yarn</Code> to install dependencies, then run <Code>yarn dev</Code> to start the app locally. <Code>yarn verify</Code> can additionally be run to check builds, linting, and tests. Once a pull request is merged into master, <Code>yarn deploy</Code> is run to deploy a test release; if everything looks good, <Code>yarn alias</Code> is run to tie the latest deployment to the <Code>trevordmiller.com</Code> domain.

              The project has three directories. <Code>static</Code>, <Code>components</Code>, and <Code>pages</Code>.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              <Anchor href='https://github.com/trevordmiller/trevordmiller-website/tree/master/static'>The static directory</Anchor> holds static files (like favicons and raster images). When the app is deployed, these can be accessed at <Code>/static/*</Code>. This functionality works by default with Next.js.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              <Anchor href='https://github.com/trevordmiller/trevordmiller-website/tree/master/components'>The components directory</Anchor> holds generic components used across app pages. These are ES2015 modules that export React components, things like Icons, Buttons, Headings etc.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              <Anchor href='https://github.com/trevordmiller/trevordmiller-website/tree/master/pages'>The pages directory</Anchor> holds app pages. A "page" is just a component, but it is special because Next.js wires up the file path to the matching route (ie <Code>pages/index.js</Code> becomes <Code>https://trevordmiller.com</Code> and <Code>pages/projects/guitar-lessons</Code> becomes <Code>https://trevordmiller.com/projects/guitar-lessons</Code>). This functionality works by default with Next.js. The page components generally just compose the generic components in the <Code>components</Code> folder to create a page. 
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              Files are organized in <Code>SomeFile</Code> named directories with an <Code>index.js</Code> for the entry point. This allows them to have sub-components or utilities that are referenced with a relative path for easy extraction into an npm published package.

        title: `Style guide`,
        component: (
          <div>
            <Paragraph>
              The project uses <Anchor href='https://github.com/trevordmiller/trevordmiller-website/blob/master/components/utils/styleGuide/index.js'>a module for a style guide</Anchor>. This is the source for shared styles like colors, spacing (padding/margin), font sizes, etc. The color scheme is <Anchor href='https://trevordmiller.com/projects/nova'>Nova</Anchor>, which I use across my projects and tools - so the style guide module simply maps colors to the <Code>nova-colors</Code> npm package values.
